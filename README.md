# erdle

The erdle tool suite can be used for just anything that can be done on VCDU (aka 
CADU) packets.

Started as an in-house tool made to dissect VCDU packets, it has in between evolved
in a full-featured tool able to reproduce features of the HRD-FE and some of the
HRDP.

Its features can be divided into two main areas:

* reporting and debugging
* networking (TBD)

erdle come with a full set of commands that ranges from forwarding reassembled
HRDL packets to counting cadus present in a set of files:

* relay
* store
* list
* index
* and many others...
